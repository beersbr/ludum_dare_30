# Ludum Dare 30

#### Theme: Connected Worlds

##### TODO/Recap: (saturda)
* Can walk between levels. 
* Need to make the level json hold more stuff.
* Need items and some pictures for the items (Should be pretty easy)
* Need more enemies
* Need (helper) text (also preetty easy)
* Need more bullet pictures
* Not sure if we are even gonna do serious animations now. (Would be cool to have a few frames per enemy/player)
* Need sound manager
* Need to update the ui for hp. (Maybe we put HP blocks above each enemy)
* Man the code is getting big. I'm starting to get scared I will spend a bit of time and move thinigs around so main isnt so scary
* 8==D

##### TODO/Recap (friday):
* Start adding enemies and non walkable tiles
* make sounds
* code up the animator object
* make more sprites
* make the walls and doors for each level
* * should each wall and door be apart of the map json?
* * * or just have a wall and door properties in the json and render accordingly?
